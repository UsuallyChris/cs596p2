## Project Name

Procedural Generation, Flocking Behavior, and Pathfinding 

Procedural generation of objects and meshes in a 3d environment which flock and fly to moving waypoints.. 

## Reflection

  This was one of the more difficult projects done during my time at SDSU. The boids are spawned from a spawner object and from then on they
  are aware of not only the way they need to fly to make their way to the generated way point, they are constantly aware of and tracking
  their neighbors.
  
  The flocking behavior can be edited in Unity to create a group as tight or far apart as wanted.
